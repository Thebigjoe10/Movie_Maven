                Due to recent issues, we had to change the download process and do away with direct download but don‚Äôt worry, we understand that a combination of the annoying ads and downloading difficulty can make any site frustrating so we are very invested in making downloads as easy as possible. All you have to do is follow this guide and you are good to go.
